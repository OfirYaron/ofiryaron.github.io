# Boost Your Productivity with Aliases

As a developer or DevOps engineer, you're likely familiar with those long and repetitive commands you use frequently in your terminal. They can be time-consuming and prone to typos, 
which hampers your productivity. But fear not! There's a solution: aliases. 

In this article, we'll explore how aliases can speed up your workflow, making your life easier and more efficient.

Why Aliases?
Aliases allow you to create custom shortcuts for commonly used commands, making them shorter and easier to remember. With aliases, you can eliminate the need to type lengthy commands repeatedly, saving you time and reducing the chances of errors. 
They offer flexibility and convenience, enabling you to streamline your day-to-day tasks and improve your productivity.

### Creating an Alias:
To create an alias, you'll need to edit your shell configuration file, typically **~/.bash_profile**, **~/.bashrc** or **~/.zshrc**. This file contains settings and configurations for your terminal session. 
Let's say you have a long command you frequently use:

```
longcommand --option1 value1 --option2 value2 argument
```


You can create an alias for it using the following steps:

- Open your terminal application.
- Locate your shell configuration file, typically **~/.bash_profile**, **~/.bashrc** or **~/.zshrc**, and open it with a text editor.
- Add the following line to define your alias:
```
alias shortcommand='longcommand --option1 value1 --option2 value2 argument'
```

(Replace **shortcommand** with the desired name for your alias.)
- Save the configuration file and close the text editor.
- Reload the configuration file in the current terminal session:
```
source ~/.bash_profile
```
<br />

### Using Parameters in Aliases:
What if you want your alias to accept dynamic parameters? Fortunately, aliases can be defined as functions, allowing you to pass arguments. Let's consider the previous example with parameters:

- Open your terminal application.
- Locate your shell configuration file and open it with a text editor.
- Add the following lines to define your alias as a function:
```
mycommand() {
    longcommand --option1 "$1" --option2 "$2"
}
```
In this example, **mycommand** is the alias name, defined as a function that accepts two parameters ("**$1**" and "**$2**""). 
- Adjust the command and parameters according to your requirements.
- Save the configuration file and close the text editor.
- Reload the configuration file in the current terminal session ans before:
```
source ~/.bash_profile
```

Now, you can use the alias with parameters just like any other command:
```
mycommand value1 value2
```
<br />

### Summary:
By leveraging aliases and command shortcuts, you can significantly enhance your workstation and optimize your day-to-day tasks. They provide a simple, yet powerful way to reduce typing, eliminate errors, and save time. 
Whether you're a developer or a DevOps engineer, incorporating aliases into your workflow will boost your productivity and improve your overall development experience.

So, go ahead and start creating aliases for your frequently used commands. Tailor them to your specific needs and watch your efficiency soar.

Professional Tip, you can also host and share them using a public repository on GitHub, that way you can download and install them on any machine you work on.
