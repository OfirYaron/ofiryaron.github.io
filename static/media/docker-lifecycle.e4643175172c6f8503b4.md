## Docker Lifecycle and Building a Dockerfile

In post, I will explore the lifecycle of Docker and explain how to use it correctly when building a Dockerfile. Docker provides a powerful and efficient way to package, distribute, and run applications in isolated environments called containers. Let's dive in!

### Build

The build phase is the first step in the Docker lifecycle. During this phase, a Docker image is created from a Dockerfile. The Dockerfile contains a set of instructions that define the steps to build the image. These instructions can include pulling base images, executing commands, copying files, and configuring the image. Docker reads the Dockerfile and builds a layered image based on the specified instructions. Each instruction in the Dockerfile creates a new layer, allowing for efficient image sharing and faster builds when changes are made.

### Image

After a successful build, an image is created. An image serves as a static, read-only template that contains all the necessary instructions for creating a container. It includes the application or service code, the runtime environment, required libraries, and dependencies needed to run the application. Images are portable and can be shared across different environments and systems, ensuring consistent execution.

### Container

A container is an instance of an image that runs as a separate process. Containers provide isolation and encapsulation, allowing applications to run consistently across different environments. They can be started, stopped, paused, and deleted. When you start a container from an image, Docker creates a new container instance based on the specified image, runs it as a process, and provides an isolated runtime environment. Containers have their file systems, network interfaces, and process trees, making them lightweight and independent units of deployment.

### Run

To start a container from an image, you can use the `docker run` command. This command creates a new container instance based on the specified image and runs it as a process. It also provides options to configure the container's runtime behavior, such as network settings, environment variables, port mappings, and resource constraints. Running a container allows you to interact with the application or service it contains.

### Lifecycle States

Containers can exist in different states throughout their lifecycle. Let's explore these states:

- **Running**: A container is in the running state when its main process or application is actively executing.
- **Paused**: Containers can be paused, temporarily suspending their processes without stopping them. Pausing a container allows you to save resources and quickly resume its execution.
- **Stopped**: When a container is stopped, it is no longer running, and its processes are halted. Stopped containers can be restarted or removed.
- **Exited**: When a container's main process completes or encounters an error and terminates, it enters the exited state. Exited containers can be restarted or removed.

### Managing Containers and Images

Docker provides a set of commands to manage containers and images:

- **Manage Containers**: You can use commands like `docker start`, `docker stop`, `docker pause`, `docker unpause`, `docker restart`, and `docker rm` to manage containers. These commands allow you to start, stop, pause, resume, restart, and remove containers as needed.

- **Manage Images**: Docker images can be managed using commands such as `docker build`, `docker pull`, `docker push`, `docker tag`, and `docker rmi`. These commands enable you to build new images, pull existing images from a registry, push images to a registry, tag images with versions or labels, and remove images when they are no longer needed.

### Dockerfile Instructions
When writing a Dockerfile, you have access to various instructions that help define the image's build process and runtime behavior. Let's take a look at some commonly used instructions and their purposes:

- **FROM**: Specifies the base image to build upon. It defines the starting point for your image and can be any existing Docker image available from a registry.
- **ARG**: Defines build-time variables that can be passed to the builder with the --build-arg flag during the docker build command. ARG values are accessible during the build process but not saved in the final image.
- **ENV**: Sets environment variables within the image. ENV instructions can define variables that will be available during the container's runtime. They are also useful for configuring the runtime behavior of the image.
- **RUN**: Executes commands during the build process. You can use RUN instructions to install packages, run scripts, compile code, or perform any necessary build-time actions. The commands specified in RUN instructions are executed in the build environment.
- **COPY** and **ADD**: These instructions allow you to copy files or directories from the host machine into the image. COPY is used to copy local files, while ADD has additional functionality like unpacking archives and fetching remote URLs.
- **WORKDIR**: Sets the working directory for subsequent instructions in the Dockerfile. It affects commands like RUN, CMD, and ENTRYPOINT, allowing you to define a specific directory within the image where these commands will be executed.
- **EXPOSE**: Informs Docker that the container listens on specific network ports at runtime. It documents the ports on which the container is expected to listen for incoming connections.
- **CMD**: Specifies the default command to run when the container starts. CMD provides the command and its arguments, which can be overridden during container execution. There can be only one CMD instruction in a Dockerfile.
- **ENTRYPOINT**: Defines the primary command that should be executed when the container starts. It is similar to CMD but allows you to specify a command that cannot be overridden by providing arguments during container execution. ENTRYPOINT can be used in combination with CMD to provide default arguments.

Throughout the lifecycle, you can make changes to the Dockerfile, rebuild the image, and recreate or update containers based on the updated image. This flexibility allows for easy iteration and maintenance of your application or service.

Remember, containers are designed to be disposable, as such it's important understand the lifecycle and use Dockerfile installation routine correctly so the important data is not part of the image creating and is able to be persisted per container.
